MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Stages

This module defines the MongoDB aggregation pipeline stages used to filter, transform, and
project data from the database. The stages are intended for use in MongoDB queries and
provide filtering conditions as well as a specific structure for the output documents.

Attributes
----------
MATCH_STAGE : dict
    A MongoDB `$match` stage that filters out documents where the `gelöscht` field is `True`
    and includes only documents where the `pflege_aktualität` (last update date) is greater
    than or equal to January 1, 2022.

PROJECTION_STAGE : dict
    A MongoDB `$project` stage that reshapes the documents to include only specific fields
    such as `ARZT_ID`, `B_ID`, `SALUTATION`, `FIRSTNAME`, `LASTNAME`, `TITLE`, and address
    components like `STREET_NAME`, `STREET_NO`, `ZIP`, and `CITY`. Fields are mapped from
    the original database fields to a new structure.

__PROJECTION_STAGE : dict
    An internal MongoDB `$project` stage that uses the same field names as they appear in
    the database, without mapping them to new names. This is primarily used for debugging
    or internal queries.

Raises
------
SystemExit
    If this file is executed as a standalone script.
